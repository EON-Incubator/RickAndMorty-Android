**Ground Rules**

* You must use MVVM as the app architecture
  * You are free to use other patterns that build on top of MVVM (e.g. MVVM+Coordinators)
* You must use Jetpack Compose to create your views
* Your implementation should use asynchronous and reactive programming (i.e. Flows, Coroutines)
* You must use Apollo GraphQL to interact with the Ricky and Morty GraphQL API
* You should have test coverage over 70% on your view models
  * You should explore both Unit and BDD testing
* You must setup KTLint locally and add it as a pre-commit hook to ensure your code is being linted
  * Read more about git hooks here https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks
  * KTLint must also be setup as a Github Check to run on all pull requests and this check must pass for a PR to be merged
